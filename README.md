## Description

_This is a mock website for an online book store. It has basic user authentication, so that only logged in users may review products, and only administrators can create, edit, and delete products._

## Installation and Setup

To install on your own machine, follow the instructions below:

* Clone this repository.
* Create a ```.env``` file and format as follows:
  ```
  PUBLISHABLE_KEY='[Your Stripe Publishable Key]'
  SECRET_KEY='[Your Stripe Secret Key]'

  CURRENCYLAYERKEY='[Your Currency Layer Key]'
  AVATAX_KEY='[Your Avatax API Key]'
  ```  
  * You will need to acquire API keys for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs), [AvaTax](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/) and [Currency Layer](https://currencylayer.com/).
* Run the following commands in the project root directory:
  ```
  bundle update
  rake db:setup
  rails db:seed
  rails s
  ```
* Open ```localhost:3000``` in your web browser
* **To give an account admin privileges:**
  * In the project root run ```rails c```
  * Then run:
    ```ruby
    User.find_by(email: "[account email address]").update(admin: true)
    ```
  * The account will now have admin access to the app.
